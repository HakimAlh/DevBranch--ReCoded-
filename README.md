# Eunoia

Old version of this is "DevsBranch"

# Update:
DevBranch has been moved from EJS to React and will be re-coded. The final product will be coming soon.

## Welcome to Eunoia!
A community-driven website for developers and even non-developers to share thoughts about development and coding. A place where you can talk or ask questions related to coding languages. Problems that others may face to be the same as yours! It can be a place for solution or a place to share your amazing development!

To improve the UI and improve overall User experience. Adding more features which gives more options to User, allowing them to be more flexible. And adding groups or organization similar to Github's organization where users can follow and get along.

Also a Profile and Search feature as well as search filter feature to search for solutions you specifically want.

## Why is it named Eunoia?
Eunoia is named the way it is because it means beautiful thinking, good will to all or wanting to help. It's catchy and has a meaning that supports what this application is about!

## Why did you choose this kind of app for the project?
Because I see how a lot of developers use websites such as 'Stack Overflow' and I take inspiration. I love to work on something that'll benefit other developers and even non-developers. Sharing their thoughts and sharing problems others can help solving brings a really nice community. Which is why I chose to go with something with the inspiration of a 'Coding Forum'.
